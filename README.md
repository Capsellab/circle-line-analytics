# Circle Line Analytics

This is meant to be a companion to our post on the Data.gov.sg blog (https://blog.data.gov.sg/how-we-caught-the-circle-line-rogue-train-with-data-79405c86ab6a). The code here was written on November 5, 2016 - the actual day when we were working on SMRT data to identify the cause of the Circle Line incidents. We acknowledge that there could be inefficiencies and welcome any comments and further sharing.
